# FARM-CHEAP Android Application

### Overview

FARM-CHEAP is an Android application developed in Java and integrated with a TensorFlow image model. The main goal of this application is to provide useful tools for farmers, leveraging weather data, image processing, and solutions based on the results obtained. It was developed in the month of June 2021.

### Features
The FARM-CHEAP Android application consists of three main pages:

#### 1. Weather Details Page
This page allows users to access weather details specific to their farm's location. By inputting the farm's location or allowing the application to access the device's GPS, users can obtain real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and other relevant meteorological data.

#### 2. Image Processing Page
The Image Processing Page enables users to capture or upload images of plants, crops, or other agricultural elements. The application utilizes an integrated TensorFlow image model to process the images and extract valuable insights. These insights may include plant disease detection, growth analysis, or any other relevant information to aid farmers in making informed decisions.

#### 3. Results and Solutions Page
Upon processing the image, the application presents the results on the screen. This page interprets the image analysis output and provides relevant solutions or recommendations to the user based on the processed data. Users can access details about detected diseases, growth patterns, or other agricultural parameters, along with recommended actions or treatments.
